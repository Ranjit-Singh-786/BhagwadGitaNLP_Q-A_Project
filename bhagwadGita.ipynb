of Bhagavad g t   is timeless and is  applicable in every facet of life', ' Within the Bhagavad g t    are the answers to the mysteries of existence   our real pur   pose in this world  how we should act and why we suffer  or  are oftentimes helpless in our struggle for survival', ' To understand the Bhagavad g t   one must enter into  the spirit of the G t  by accepting the path of devotion   bhakti  ', ' Accordingly  the G t  s  message cannot be prop   erly understood by mental speculation', ' To this end  the  sublime process illuminated within the G t  must be  accepted as given by the speaker Himself   r  K   a', ' The active principle of understanding the message of  the G t  is to hear directly from the Master of yoga   r   K   a  who is glorified throughout the Vedic literature as  the Supreme Person  the Absolute Truth', '  r  K   a speaks  to Arjuna in Bhagavad g t   and thus one who studies the  G t  hears from K   a directly', ' The philosophy of Bhagavad g t   is clear for the sincere  reader  yet for some  approaching the G t  may seem daunt   ing   its language too ancient', ' However  this obstacle is  easily overcome by a straightforward translation and com   mentary   Anuv tti  ', ' The requirement for a translation and  commentary on the G t  is as necessary today as anytime  in the past', ' With the passing of time  our values and our  world view are constantly changing  and this demands a  fresh approach to the understanding of the G t ', ' This translation and commentary on the  Bhagavad g t    provides simple  yet profound knowledge to elevate us to  a higher state of consciousness whereby we can realise our Prefacex true self and progress towards attaining a life of spiritual  fulfilment', ' Self realisation means to realise our actual  purpose in life and act towards it  gradually freeing us  from the yoke of material bondage', ' Where there is light   darkness cannot stand   where there is proper knowledge   ignorance cannot remain', ' The Bhagavad g t   unravels  the mysteries of life  providing not only knowledgeable  answers  but also a progressive process to uplift us to pure  consciousness', ' One of the more remarkable features of the G t  is  that its readers can easily observe and feel its philosophy  working  like poetry in motion  in their everyday lives', ' The  knowledge of Bhagavad g t   is a true science   its formu   las for success clear and observable in action', ' The Bhaga   vad g t   thus provides a complete outline for self realisa   tion in everyday life', ' Anyone who is fortunate enough to dive deeply into the  wisdom of the Bhagavad g t   and embrace its message will  surely achieve success  for this is guaranteed in the G t  s   final verse  yatra yoge vara  k   o yatra p rtho dhanur dhara    tatra  r r vijayo bh tir dhruv  n tir matir mama Where there is  r  K   a  the Master of yoga  and  where there is Arjuna  the mighty archer  there  will always be prosperity  victory  opulence and  righteousness   this is my firm conviction', ' Sv m  B', 'B', ' Vi  uxi Bhagavad g t   is the oldest and most widely read book  of theistic science in the world today', ' Also known as the  G topani ad   the Bhagavad g t   has been the principle  handbook of yoga for more than 5 000 years', ' In contrast  to many mundane literatures of the present day  the Bhaga   vad g t   is free from mental speculation and is complete  in knowledge of the eternal self    tm    the process of  bhakti yoga  and the nature and identity of the Absolute  Truth   r  K   a', ' As such  the Bhagavad g t   is the single  most important book in the world  surpassing all others in  wisdom and enlightenment', ' The first word of Bhagavad g t   is dharma ', ' Sometimes  dharma  is mistaken to mean religion or a particular belief   but it is not so', ' Dharma  means the quintessential duty  or knowledge that elevates our consciousness to a direct  connection with the Absolute Truth', ' This is also known  as san tana dharma   the occupational duty of all living  beings', ' The Bhagavad g t   begins with the word dharma     thus we can understand from the outset that Bhaga   vad g t   is not about dogma or a sectarian way of thinking', '  Indeed  Bhagavad g t   is the complete science of realising  the Absolute Truth', '  For an observant person it is clear that the world around  us is a bewildering place with many unsolved mysteries', ' If  one is seeking answers to the age old questions of  Who  am I    Why do we suffer    Where do we come from     What is the purpose of life    What happens after death      then one will find great satisfaction in the Bhagavad g t    because the G t  answers these questions and more with  the utmost clarity', 'Intr oductionxii As a young seeker of truth  I first came in contact with  the Bhagavad g t   in 1968', ' In subsequent years I travelled  to India and studied Bhagavad g t   under the foremost  gurus of the late 20th Century  A', 'C', ' Bhaktived nta Sv m   Prabhup da and Sv m  B', 'R', '  r dhara Deva Gosv m ', ' By  the goodwill of these two great masters  the essential mes   sage of Bhagavad g t   entered my heart and I was soon to  be situated on the path of self realisation', ' As with any path in life  one will certainly encounter  crossroads', ' The first crossroad that I came to while study   ing the Bhagavad g t   was to decide on the path   personal  or impersonal', ' Was I to follow the path of personalism    to perfect the individual self  to enter into the spiritual sky  of Vaiku  ha planets and live eternally with the Supreme  Person   r  K   a  Or was I to follow the path of imper   sonalism   ending existence as an individual living being  and merging myself into the brahma jyoti  of infinite bliss   I chose the former  personalism  bhakti yoga  ', ' Bhagavad g t   is specifically meant for those following  the path of bhakti yoga', '  Many impersonal philosophers  have tried to lay claim to the G t  over the years  at times  even claiming to be  r  K   a   a claim that is exposed by  the simple fact that they do not understand the message of   r  K   a in Bhagavad g t    despite its profound clarity', '  r   K   a is the original speaker of Bhagavad g t    therefore  He must know the message of the G t  better than anyone   and K   a says in the Eighteenth Chapter that the message  of the G t  is exclusively meant for those who are aspiring  to know the Absolute Truth on the path of bhakti yoga ', ' Bhagavad g t   is certainly a scholarly work  but one  need not be a scholar to understand the G t  s  straightfor  xiii ward and simple message', ' Indeed  Arjuna  the first student  of Bhagavad g t    was not a scholar  but a warrior', ' In the  past many great scholars  gurus and self realised masters  have written illuminating commentaries to accompany the  G t    its  as it is  meaning  its poetry  philosophy and  its hidden treasure   so that the people of their time  as  well as the people of future generations  may have a better  appreciation of the message of  r  K   a', ' We have now completed the first decade of the 21st  Century and a host of such erudite commentaries on the  Bhagavad g t   sit upon our bookshelves and in our libraries    surely there is no call for yet another  The message of Bhagavad g t   is eternal and unchang   ing  but the time that surrounds us is always changing  thus  our perception of life  our current situation and our neces   sity is also always changing', ' To meet the changing times  and the present necessity  yet another commentary is being  presented   a brief commentary  or Anuv tti ', ' According to Vi van tha Cakravart   a renowned com   mentator on the Bhagavad g t   from antiquity  the first six  chapters of the G t  mainly pertain to karma   the second  six chapters to bhakti  and the final six chapters to j  na ', '  But the answers to life s most puzzling questions are found  throughout the eighteen chapters of the G t  with  r   K   a s last and conclusive instruction to Arjuna in verse  66 of the last chapter   sarva dharm n parityajya m m  eka   ara a  vraja', '   In our Anuv tti  we have not commented on each and  every verse spoken by  r  K   a as we feel that by directly  hearing from K   a with one s intelligence  one receives  the greatest knowledge and further comment is not always xiv necessary', ' The comments made in the Anuv tti  are to  highlight certain points and to reflect on what K   a says  with relevance to our world today', ' What lies ahead in our  Anuv tti  are the basics of Gau  ya Vai  ava philosophy   acintya bhed bheda tattva   and the essential understanding  for the practice of bhakti yoga ', ' Many readers may want to delve deeper into the knowl   edge of Bhagavad g t   and for such persons we highly  recommend the study of the 1973 Macmillan edition of  Bhagavad g t  As It Is  by A', 'C', ' Bhaktived nta Sv m  Prab   hup da', ' Other recommended readings are the commen   taries of Vi van tha Cakravart   Baladeva Vidy bh  a a   Bhaktivinoda  h kura and Sv m  B', 'R', '  r dhara Deva  Gosv m ', ' We would like to express our sincere appreciation for  those who have encouraged us in our work and helped  to bring Bhagavad g t      r  K   a s Illuminations on the  Perfection of Yoga  to completion', ' We especially want to  mention here our godbrothers  Sv m  Bhakti Bh vana  Vi  u  Jayadeva  Jagad  vara  our godsister Dh ra lalit    and our sanny s   disciples  Sv m  Bhakti Vij  na Giri and  Harid sa

Since time immemorial  the Bhagavad g t   has been a  prime source of inspiration for many great thinkers and  philosophers in both the east and the west', ' In ancient  times  the first commentary on the G t  was written by   di  a kara  who was the first  c rya  to treat it as a free   standing text', ' Subsequently  other great  c ryas  such as  R m nuja  Madhva   r dhara Sv m  and others wrote  commentaries on the G t  that presented its essential  devotional significance  in stark contrast to  di  a kara s  impersonal interpretation', ' In the western world  the Bhagavad g t   has been  highly appreciated by erudite scholars and philosophers  such as Henry David Thoreau  Friedrich Schlegel  Arthur   Schopenhauer  Carl Jung and Herman Hesse', ' Upon read   ing the G t   the famous American transcendentalist  Ralph  Waldo Emerson commented  I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad g t ', ' It was the  first of books  it was as if an empire spoke to us  nothing  small or unworthy  but large  serene  consistent  the voice  of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had  pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which  exercise us', '  Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson   Originally  the Bhagavad g t   is part of the ancient his   torical epic  the Mah bh rata   composed by the great sage  Vy sa in approximately 3100 BCE', ' The eighteen chapters  of the Bhagavad g t  are found within the Sixth Canto of  the Mah bh rata  known as the Bh  ma parva   which alto  The Histor y of Bhaga v ad gitaxvi gether contains 117 chapters', ' Initially Vy sa wrote the  8 800 core verses of the Mah bh rata  and later his disciples  Vai amp yana and S ta added further historical details  until the Mah bh rata  finally consisted of 100 000 verses    seven times the size of Homer s Illiad and fifteen times  the size of the King James Bible', '  The word Mah bh rata  means  The History of Greater  India  and recounts the story of two feuding royal fam   ilies  the P   avas  the sons of P   u  and their cous   ins  the Kauravas  the sons of Dh tar   ra ', ' Both P   u  and his brother Dh tar   ra belonged to the royal Kuru  Dynasty of Hastin pura  modern day Delhi ', ' Although  Dh tar   ra was the elder of the two  he was born blind  and so the throne was passed on to P   u  who became  the heir apparent', ' However P   u died untimely  leaving five children    Yudhi  hira  Arjuna  Bh ma  Nakula and Sahadeva', ' While  the P   avas were still young  their uncle Dh tar   ra  assumed the throne as regent until they were of age to rule  the kingdom', ' Yet due to his excessive paternal attachment   Dh tar   ra schemed that his own sons  led by the corrupt  Duryodhana  would ascend the imperial throne', ' To this  end  and with the consent of his father  Duryodhana made  several assassination attempts upon the lives of the P   a   vas', ' Despite the wise counsel of his grandfather Bh  ma  his  uncle Vidura and his military teacher Dro a  Duryodhana  continued to plot against his cousins', ' Yet  due to the pro   tection of  r  K   a  the P   avas were able to foil all his  murderous attempts', '  Historically speaking   r  K   a was the nephew of  P   u s wife Queen Kunt  and was thus the cousin of the xvii P   avas', ' However  K   a was not simply a royal prince   but the Supreme Person Himself who had descended to  Earth to perform His pastimes and to establish the princi   ples of dharma ', ' Due to their righteous behaviour   r  K   a  always favoured the P   avas', ' After numerous failed murder attempts  Duryodhana  finally challenged the P   avas to a rigged game of dice', '  Duryodhana cheated and won the game  and the P   avas  lost their kingdom', ' The result was that the P   avas were  forced

highest realm in the universe known as Satya loka', '  Some of the offspring of Brahm  known as the Praj patis  are then sent forth to seed life throughout the cosmos', '  But rather than look at Brahm  as an alien  the Vedic  texts describe him as the father of all living beings in the  material world', ' Since western civilisation first came into contact with  the pantheon of Vedic demigods

western  observers conclude that monotheism  the worship or rever   ence of one Supreme God  originated with the Abrahamic  religions of the west', ' This however is not a fact', ' The Vedic pantheon

Centuries  Judaism and  Christianity were known to have belief systems based on  one or more gods', ' Thus  monotheism only gradually devel   oped among the Abrahamic religions', ' Since the monotheistic concept found in the Vedas  is  much older than the Abrahamic religions  it is only logical  to conclude that the latter borrowed their thinking from  the former', ' During the interim  the Persians  under the  influence of Zoroaster  took the monotheistic philosophy  from India and then transmitted it to the Middle Eastern  civilisations', ' Indeed  monotheism has always been the cen   tral theme of India s Vedic literature', ' However  failing to look deeply into the philosophy  of the Vedas  or possibly being culturally intimidated by  the superiority of Vedic knowledge as

propagated further misinformation on this subject in the  19th Century with the invention of the Aryan Invasion  Theory  stating that Vedic civilisation did not originate in  India', ' Yet all this is quite far from the truth', ' According to Muller  the  ryans  were a nomadic tribe  from Europe who invaded India', ' Yet there is no evidence  that the  ryans  were nomads', ' In fact  to suggest that a  nomadic tribe of barbarians wrote literature of such pro   found wisdom as the Vedas  defies imagination', ' Furthermore  within the Vedas   there is no mention what   soever of an original homeland  and archaeologically there  is a complete lack of evidence to prove an invasion ever 82 Bhagavad gitaoccurred', ' It can only be concluded that the  ryan  people  and Vedic knowledge were always indigenous to India', ' The Vedic knowledge is that Vi  u K   a is Supreme  and the lesser gods and goddesses such as Brahm    iva   Ga e a  K rtikeya  K l  and Sarasvat  etc', ' are actually serv   ants of the Supreme Being and are empowered with the  duties of managing the universal affairs of material nature', '  In the above verses  r  K   a recommends that offerings  should be made to the demigods and thus the demigods  will be pleased to bestow unto humanity all the necessities  of life', ' This is  in short  a universal law of taxation', ' In  other words  we must give the demigods their dues', ' It is also intrinsic to the nature of the  tm   to perform  service and sacrifice', ' Constitutionally the  tm   being part  of the organic whole  the Absolute Truth   is duty bound  to serve the whole  both in this life and in eternity', ' When  sacrifice or offerings are made to Vi  u such as fruits  veg   etables etc', ' then one s senses become purified by eating the  remnants of such offerings', ' But if one takes the things of  this world without first acknowledging to whom they actu   ally belong  then one simply incurs a karmic  reaction', ' This  also includes our daily food that should first be offered  to Vi  u K   a', ' It will be explained by  r  K   a later in  Bhagavad g t   that these food offerings should comprise  of vegetables  fruits  milk products  flowers etc', ' Non veg   etarian food items cannot be offered to Vi  u or K   a    consequently the servants of Vi  u K   a are vegetarian', '  K   a will also explain that those who serve

compiler of the Yoga  s tras   Pata jali has explained the sequential order of the  a    ga yoga  system as follows   First  one should practice yama  that consists of obser   vances such as rising from bed before sunrise  taking bath   study of the Vedas  and performing p j   rituals ', '  Niyama  consists of controlling the senses by following  regulative principles such as no intoxication  no illicit sex   no gambling and no eating of meat  fish or eggs', '  Next one begins the practice of  sana  by physically  conditioning the body through systematic bodily exercises  and postures aimed at toning and bringing into balance  one s entire physical organism', ' 156 Bhagavad gitaThen one advances to the performance of pr   y ma    controlling the inward and outward breath by systematic  breathing exercises performed in conjunction with vari   ous  sanas ', ' When  sanas  and pr   y ma  are performed  or taught just for the sake of health  this is sometimes  called ha ha yoga ', ' After pr   y ma  follows praty h ra   or withdrawing  the senses from the sense objects and training the mind to  become introspective and intuitively orientated', ' Then one  is able to concentrate the mind on a single point without  being disturbed', ' This is known as dh ra     or attaining  concentration', '  Once having acquired the ability to concentrate the  mind without distractions from external sources  one can  begin actual meditation  or dhy na ', ' There are many forms  of meditation in the yoga system  however none of them  recommend concentrating on nothingness', ' The three prin   ciple objects of meditation in yoga are Brahman  transcen   dental light   Param tm   localised Super Consciousness   and Bhagav n   r  K   a ', ' Sam dhi  is the final stage of a    ga yoga  wherein the  yog   at the time of quitting the material body  attains the  object of his desired perfection', ' The yog s who desire Brah   man or Param tm  realisation enter the brahma jyoti  after  giving up their body and the yog  who desires Bhagav n  realisation enters into the Supreme Abode of K   a known  as Vaiku  ha or Goloka V nd vana to associate with and  participate in transcendental pastimes with K   a', ' According to many masters of yoga  only Bhagav n real   isation is eternal', ' Even after attaining Brahman or Para   m tm  realisations and merging into the Supreme Brahman  Chapter 6157 a yog  will once again have to come back to the material  world and begin again the cycle of birth and death', ' This  is said to be due to the intrinsic nature of all living beings  to perform activities', ' Although in the brahma jyoti  there  is a sense of bliss that is many thousands of times greater  than material happiness  still the desire to act remains', ' But  because the Brahman realised yog  and the Param tm  real   ised yog  are not qualified to perform devotional activities  in the association of K   a  they cannot enter the spiritual  planets and must therefore come down to take birth again  in the material world', ' VERSE 8                                                                    j  na vij  na t pt tm  k  astho vijitendriya  yukta ityucyate yog

them and is thus far undetectable', ' They have called this   Dark Matter ', 'Chapter 7183 The first person to provide evidence and infer the  existence of the phenomenon of Dark Matter was the  Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky  of the California Insti   tute of Technology in 1933', ' Zwicky applied the viral  theorem to the Coma cluster of galaxies and obtained evi   dence of unseen mass', ' Zwicky estimated the cluster s total  mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and  compared that estimate to one based on the number of  galaxies and total brightness of the cluster', ' He found that  there was about four hundred times more estimated mass  than was visually observable', ' The gravity of the visible  galaxies in the cluster would be far too small for such fast  orbits  so something extra was required', ' This is known as  the  Missing Mass Problem ', ' Based on these conclusions   Zwicky inferred that there must be some non visible form  of matter that would provide enough of the mass and  gravity to hold the cluster together', ' That was the begin   ning of the search for Dark Matter', ' Seventy eight years later  science is still looking for  Dark Matter', ' They know it is literally everywhere  but it  escapes detection and thus they are unable to observe it', '  Millions in taxpayers  money is spent every year by western  scientists in the search for Dark Matter', ' Nothing has yet  been discovered', ' However  the  r mad Bh gavatam  identifies a material  element that among its other qualities is  for the most part   elusive', ' It is all pervading  but simultaneously it is unde   tectable', ' That element according to Bh gavatam  is called  nabhas   or as mentioned here in Bhagavad g t   kha ', ' The activities  qualities and characteristics of the kha    element can be observed as accommodating space room 184 Bhagavad gitafor existence', ' Space itself  both internal and external  is the  element kha  ', ' This then  if taken notice of by physicists   may very well fit nicely into the  Missing Mass Problem ', '  Kha    being a material element  could theoretically be  assigned a numerical code   then they might find what  they are looking for', ' In the Vedic way of thinking  a physical element is  secondary to its qualities   when the qualities of a par   ticular thing are understood  it is as good as or better than  having the gross object at hand', ' In that sense  modern  science has already discovered Dark Matter  because they  have understood something of its qualities   they just hav   en t realised it yet', ' In the  r mad  Bh gavatam  we find the  following verse  bh t n   chidra d t tva  bahir antaram eva ca pr  endriy tma dhi  yatva  nabhaso v tti lak a am The activities and characteristics of

gavatam 3', '26', '34  This verse is the potential basis for great scientific  research work', ' It explains how subtle forms are generated  from nabhas   what their characteristics and actions are   and how the tangible elements  namely air  fire  water and  earth  are manifested from the subtle form', ' Bh gavatam  does not simply list the basic material ele   ments  but explains quite scientifically how those elements  evolve from the most subtle plane of existence up to the Chapter 7185 divisions of the universe   this is quite elaborate and sci   entific indeed', ' Yet for science to take full advantage of this  understanding of matter and to discover how the universe  came into being  they will have to do more than just add  kha  to their table of elements   they will have to add  aha k ra   false ego   mana   the mind  and buddhi   intel   ligence ', ' For indeed  Bhagavad g t   lists these as material  elements', ' Furthermore  these elements  aha k ra  mana   and buddhi  are categorised as even more subtle than kha     because they are closer in character to consciousness    tm  ', ' Beyond the gross and subtle material elements being  added to the scientific table  Bhagavad g t   says that a  complete understanding of existence and reality is not  possible without adding two transcendental  anti material  concepts   namely  tm  and Param tm   consciousness  and Super Consciousness ', ' This  it seems  science strug   gles with even more than Dark Matter', ' We have dubbed  these  Light Matter ', ' Mind and intelligence should not be confused with the  self or  tm ', ' Mind and intelligence have not arisen out of  matter as some philosophers or scientists have suggested', '  Last in the list is aha k ra  or false ego', ' All these are mate   rial elements which manifest from the apar  prak ti  or the  inferior energy of K   a', ' These gross and subtle elements  make up the material body and cover the self within', ' Those conditioned by material elements consider the  body as the self', ' But K   a says that there is another energy  of His   a superior energy  which is a conscious potency  and consists of all living
